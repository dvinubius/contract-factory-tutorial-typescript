# Tutorial 

## Goals
Whether you're a web3 noob or experienced dev, the following tutorial is a good way to 
- get more **familiar with scaffold-eth**
- learn some ideas for **design patterns**

If you're in for the tutorial, you're in for a treat! 🍭 🤓 Here's what we'll look at

1. Explore the setup - what can a user do?
2. Technicalities - how is it built so far?
3. UX challenges - where can you take it from here? 
# 1. 🤩 Explore the setup

> 🔖 **Create and track** contracts that each have a "purpose" variable

In the "Your Contracts" tab, create a new contract. The dialog keeps the user informed. This is a **common UX pattern** beyond the generic tx status notifications.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/147391797-3f34eb6a-87cb-4142-9c84-9c311378d5a6.png" width="350">

> 🗺 **Browse** all contracts in a list : ```<CreatedContractsUI/>```

Your new contract should have appeared in the UI. Create a second contract. Observe how the **list updates automatically** as soon as the transaction is mined.

List items right now only contain data that was available at the moment when the contracts were **created**.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/147391831-ff917ad9-5e1e-4f65-b0a5-afff84a40a39.png" width="400">

> 🕹 **Interact** with any particular contract in a detail view: ```<YourContract/>```

Click on a contract to enter the detailed view.

Click any button to change its purpose.

> 🔐 **Access controls** are in place

Open a new browser window in incognito mode, go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Here you won't be able to change the purpose of existing contracts. In this incognito window you are someone else (notice the address at the top of the window). The current signer is not the owner of those contracts.

> 𝌋 The **Debug UI** enables raw interaction with the factory and any created contract instance.

🧐 Check out the "Debug Contracts" tab.
- See what the public functions of YourContractFactory allow you to do. Do you find them useful?
- What else might be useful to have in there?

> ** 👩‍💻 😍  **UX** 😍 🧑‍💻 Frontend Side Quest  - Improve UX when setting the purpose **

Return to the UI where you have 2 buttons to set the purpose of a contract.
 
**Issue**: if you click any of the buttons, both show a spinner while the TX is pending.

**Your challenge**: find a way to obtain this instead

![Screenshot 2021-12-24 at 10 06 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/147392069-d39470b2-4c9b-47a0-b57d-31e20a5b8107.png)


# 2. 🤓 Technicalities
### YourContract.sol

- The core functionality of your app

- Right now it only has a purpose that can be changed by the owner.

### YourContractFactory.sol

- Creates instances of YourContract and keeps track of them all.

- Kept as lean as possible. 
 
The setup allows **users to create** their own YourContracts **and control them** independent from the factory contract.

As a starting point for developing dApps with this setup, we want **loose coupling**:
- keep created contracts unaware of the factory
- keep the factory unaware of what created contracts actually do

All our factory needs to know is the addresses of created contracts 

![Screenshot 2021-12-25 at 21 18 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/147392127-cfc954b4-9e44-4d22-9456-93a4a7521124.png)

![Screenshot 2021-12-25 at 21 19 33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/147392129-60b10955-8aac-45ca-be60-a804d098fc0f.png)


We emit **events on contract creation**, so the frontend can easily retrieve a list of all.

![Screenshot 2021-12-25 at 21 20 20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/147392136-c64bf671-4ffd-423e-bcf5-1fe76d74a1c5.png)
![Screenshot 2021-12-25 at 21 19 58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/147392138-d4351c71-f5ec-4d6a-8a09-29f0693a3fdd.png)

We've included useful data in those events.

## 📇 Readable Names
👩‍💻 😍 **UX** 😍 🧑‍💻 
In a dApp based on a setup like ours, user-given **individual contract names** are probably a good feature to have. 

We've adopted a *simple and cheap* solution: the user-given name is put in the creation event. If the name doesn't need to change over time this approach works fine.

This retrieval happens via **a single RPC** call made by the ```useEventListener``` hook in ```MainPage.tsx```.
The retrieval is repeated on each block but can be configured much more specifically to suit your needs. Read more about it in the [docs](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth-libraries/v/eth-hooks-v4/).

It's good to keep something like this in mind in order to have your app scale well when the UI is rich and lots of users are using it at the same time.

For **contract state**, like "purpose", contract owner, etc. the frontend uses the address of a particular YourContract intance address to read from the contract, which under the hood makes separate RPC calls.

This is what we do in ```<YourContract/>```

![Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 22 32 48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/150031270-9c2fc86b-10fc-47a9-9a3f-45c0fb87e12b.png)


### 🤓 Very optional nerdy side quest for TS-enthusiasts
> At the moment you don't get strong typing and autocomplete when attempting to (read/write) interact with ```YourContract```, like you do with ```YourContractFactory```. At least not out of the box. 
> 
> Strong typing is only available out-of-the box for contracts deployed by ```yarn deploy```. In our factory setup you deploy the factory via a script, but all ```YourContract``` instances are **created by the factory contract** when users interact with it.
> 
> You can still **obtain strong typing** by doing the following: 
> - include YourContract in the deployment script in `packages/hardhat-ts/deploy`. The code for that is commented out. Uncomment it. This will deploy one instance of ```YourContract``` when the deploy script runs.
> 
> - Uncomment the related code in ```packages/vite-app-ts/src/config/contractConnectorConfig.ts``` . You will easily identify that code 😉
> 
> - Run ```yarn deploy --reset```
> 
> You'll have an instance of ```YourContract``` deployed somewhere, but your App won't show it in any way. However, your IDE will now know you that ```YourContract``` has a ```purpose```, a ```setPurpose``` etc.

Observe how yourContractRaw is now typed more precisely:

![Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 23 00 27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/150031716-fa652735-5ab0-4f11-bef9-90fa7dcfb827.png)

![Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 23 00 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/150031706-03bd9f3f-f765-4202-ae26-6226fb64d5f8.png)


> Don't forget to put the comments back in when you deploy your dApp to mainnet. Or you will **totally waste gas ⛽️ 💰 ** on that lonely YourContract instance!
> 
> This may be possible to solve more elegantly in the future, watch out for updates!


## 👨🏻‍💻 🤓  Knitty Gritty Aside - "manually" created contract objects
You may skip this section and tackle Challenge 1 below if you're eager to code some more. Just make sure to return here some time later. 

Understanding this is crucial if you're serious about building factory pattern dApps, so you'll need to do it anyway. But no pressure right now 😎 🧉

> 📝 Notice the difference in working with ```YourContractFactory``` and ```YourContract```: 
>
> The factory contract object is obtained neatly via a hook. Here is the pattern, in a **simplified** version
> 
> ```
> const ethersContext = useEthersContext();
> 
> const yourContractFactory = useAppContracts(
>     'YourContractFactory',
>     ethersContext.chainId
> );
> ```
>
> 
> For the ```yourContract``` object we make use of **```injectableAbis```**, which are configured to give you the abi for ```YourContract```. With that equipped, we create a "raw" ```BaseContract``` which we then connect to a signer. 
> 
> Here is a **simplified** version of the code:
> 
> ```
> const yourContractRaw = new BaseContract(
>     contractAddress,
>     abi,
>     provider
> );
> 
> const yourContract = yourContractRaw.connect(signer);
> ```
> 
> The useAppContracts() hook cannot be used to interact with contracts that were not deployed via ```yarn deploy```. 
> 
> If you wonder how ```injectableAbis``` comes to know the ```YourContract``` abi, it's due to the deployment setup of the hardhat project.
> 
> 🧐 Notice the file ```vite-app-ts/src/generated/injectable-abis/hardhat_non_deployed_contracts.json``` 
> 
> This one is **usually not present in scaffold-eth** because we usually include all our contracts when we ```yarn deploy```. Each one gets a fixed deployment address there.
> 
> But in our **factory setup**, the ``YourContract`` instances are **created on-chain**. Only then they get their addresses, which are stored both in the factory contract state and in the contract creation events. 
> 


## **Challenge** 1 -- Track purpose changes

> Lets show our users when and how purpose changes happen!

Find the Solidity code related to SetPurpose events. Uncomment it.

Redeploy with ```yarn deploy --reset```

Find the React code that displays SetPurpose events in ```<YourContract/>```. It is commented out, uncomment it.

Create a new contract. Change its purpose.

> Now, for any particular instance of YourContract, our app
> - displays contract events
> - displays contract state
> - enables contract interaction

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/147393032-18a74fd9-278d-41c9-891c-d1de4f54c79a.png" width="400">


## 🔐 🧑‍💻 🔏 Ownership

Our factory ensures that the user who creates a contract also becomes the owner

![Screenshot 2021-12-25 at 22 25 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/147393099-177ff144-d90b-4c67-859d-b608e00279ec.png)


Without this code, the factory would remain the owner of all YourContract instances.

# 3. 👩‍💻 😍 🧑‍💻 UX CHALLENGES

## **Challenge** 2 -- Contract details in the list item
 
> Suppose we wanted to **display the owner** of any contract in the master view. Probably your users want to easily identify the contracts they've created.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/147393199-3131cbac-c3b6-4375-94b7-46d864bcde46.png" width="350">

The owner can change over time, unlike the creator. We can't build this feature by using contract creation event data.

> 🤔 How do we get the owners of all contracts? 

In each ```<ContractItem />```, we apply the pattern from ```<YourContract/>```: we take the contract abi & address, we create a BaseContract object, so that we can read from that particular contract instance. 

Go to ```ContractItem.tsx``` and find the code that fetches owner data. Uncomment it.

Find the code that displays this data. Uncomment that.

Now you should see owner information in the contracts list of the master view.

📝 🤓 Observe that this time we **didn't connect any signer**, since we only had to read from the contract. Also, we **didn't specify a fourth argument to useContractReader**. That one is with options on how the value should be updated. But we don't expect the owner to change while this React component is displayed, so we provide no explicit update options. When no updateOptions are provided, the default behaviour of the hook is to only update once every 100 blocks, which is acceptable in a situation like ours. 

> #### 🧞‍♀️ Side quest - Make this perfect! 💯
> Find out how to useEventListener() such that it only updates if the owner actually changes. Perfect the code. Can you test if it works?

### 👩‍💻 😍 🧑‍💻 **Recognize** my contract
> Owner addresses are quite hard to read. In the contracts list, let's **mark** items which belong to **the current user** so they may be identified more easily.

Go to the code inside the ```<ContractItem/>``` component. Find the commented code which marks the item when the contract owner is the current user. Uncomment it. Do the required fixes to make these changes effective (you will have to remove / comment out some of the initial code in order to make Typescript happy)

You should now see contract items like this:

![Screenshot 2022-01-19 at 00 28 35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32189942/150033710-37a9b108-e8c5-439e-9ada-bc2659f56cc9.png)

☑️ Test the functionality by creating contracts from an incognito window. Compare the views of different users.

## **Challenge** 3 -- Scalable UI (hard)

> What if there were 100 contracts? 
> 
> As soon as you receive the creation event data in ```MainPage.tsx```, would you make a total of 100 requests for reading the owner of each contract within its ```<ContractItem />``` component?

It's probably better if we retrieve the owner of a particular contract item only when the item is actually in view.

Here is a simple solution for that:

### 👩‍💻 😍 🧑‍💻 **Pagination** for the contract list 

 
> - This would improve the UX a lot, whether we display contract owners or not
> - If you allow n contracts per page, only n calls to read the owner will be made at once.

## Other advanced UX Side Quests 

> 👩‍💻 😍 🧑‍💻  Allow users to **filter** contracts by name in the list view 

- use an input field
- how do you combine this with the pagination feature?
  
> 👩‍💻 😍 🧑‍💻  Allow users to **filter** contracts by only listing their own ones 

- use a switch or checkbox "only mine"
- how do you combine this with the pagination feature?

# Final Thoughts

## 0 Key Improvements

A factory setup can quickly get very complex, especially if you want to provide good UX.

Your real-world project will probably need code design improvements in order to be able to scale well and be easy to use.
- good routing
- efficient data retrieval (RPC nodes)
- different empty states (waiting for data, data not available, no account connected)
- clean code

Some design patterns to help you grow can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/dvinubius/tiny-multisig). It's not in typescript but still worth a dig into. 

- master-detail UI pattern with **shareable links** to detail pages (routing with **react router v6**)
- a pattern on how to create a **contract specific react context** when opening a contract in the UI
- strategies to **minimize** number of **RPC calls** while using eth-hooks v2.

With the flexibility that eth-hooks V4 gives you in the current setup, you'd be able to optimize even easier.

## 1 Opinionated Solutions
Our approaches in solving UX challenges depend on many factors. If your project is going to have lots of complex data to retrieve, you'll probably also use a [**subgraph**](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth/toolkit/infrastructure/the-graph) or other blockchain indexing tools. These are more capable than the ```useEventListener``` hook we've used here. This would impact how you approach scaling your dApp.

## 2 Factory Use Cases

> There are many use cases for a setup similar to ours here. Take **Uniswap**:
> - users create liquidity pools
> - each liquidity pool is a separate contract
> 
> Sometimes the created contracts may be more tightly coupled to the factory - it depends on the use case: how much **control over the contracts** should a user have / should the factory keep?

> ** 🧙‍♂️ 🧝‍♀️ 🧞‍♂️ **Advanced Contract Design** Quest: Dig into the [UniswapV3](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/reference/core/UniswapV3Factory) Docs.
> Here the factory is indeed more tightly coupled to the created pools.
> - Why, do you think, is that?
> - How does Uniswap handle fees?
>   - pool owner fees?
>   - uniswap fees?
